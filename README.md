# Explanation
This is a test Wiki for service discussions and for recording conventions and insights related to the Cytoscape Cyberinfrastructure (CI)

It is broken into sections that can be realigned as discussions change and group conscientiousness shifts.

The wiki is organized around sections (e.g., CX, SLAs, Coding Conventions, ELSA, Services, etc). 

Sections are organized by status sub-sections (e.g., loose thoughts, proposal, adoption, early documentation, mature documentation, etc).

Subsections contain collections of pages titled to describe content.

Editing the structure and article content is encouraged, as are comments on article content.
